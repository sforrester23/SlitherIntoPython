# Memoization: Basically caching information so it can be re-used later on 
# # without having to make the same calls repeatedly that can slow down 
# performance of a function or procedure

# Recursion: Expressing the problem as a simpler/smaller example of the same problem
# can be used to break down complicated problems/procedures into smaller versions of the same issue 
# until it reaches a base case of that problem that is solved simply.
